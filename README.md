The repository contains code that can be used to reproduce results from the following journal paper:

Golden, D. I., Lipson, J. A., Telli, M. L., Ford, J. M., & Rubin, D. L. (2013). Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI-based biomarkers of therapeutic response in triple-negative breast cancer. Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association. doi:10.1136/amiajnl-2012-001460

The paper is available online at [http://jamia.bmj.com/content/early/2013/06/25/amiajnl-2012-001460.abstract](http://jamia.bmj.com/content/early/2013/06/25/amiajnl-2012-001460.abstract)

The code was written primarily by Daniel Golden. You can contact him at "dgolden1", followed by gmail dot com.

Not all required code has been licensed for inclusion at this time (e.g., the pharmacokinetic modeling code). Inclusion is hopefully forthcoming.

To fully reproduce the results, you will also need the MRI data. We are actively seeking permission to release that data.
